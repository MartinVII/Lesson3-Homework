First habit - I completely agree with this first habit of having right posture during sitting on chair and overall keeping my body in healthy condition.
Second habit - Get it done - this speaks for itself, just dont waste a lot of time with figuring out some small little bug.
Third habit - Keeping lines of code as simple as possible is one of the most important things in programming to me.
Fourth habit - Having uninterrupted periods of time while coding is very important to think over problems I face. It helps me to solve problems much faster.
Fifth habit - I agree, learning and practice makes perfect.
Sixth habit - Even though it is very important to work in group and discuss progress or problems I like solving challenging problems on my own.
Seventh habit - According to my own experience I agree with this point.
